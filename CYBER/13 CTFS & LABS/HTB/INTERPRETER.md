## 1. Reconnaissance & Discovery

### 1.1 Connecting to the HTB VPN

First, download your personalized `.ovpn` file from Hack The Box.

Connect to the HTB VPN using the `.ovpn` configuration file. This establishes a secure tunnel that allows access to the target machine’s internal network.

Command: `sudo openvpn your_file.ovpn`

Start the Machine.

### 1.2. Verifying the Target is Reachable

Verify that the target machine is up and reachable by performing an ICMP ping test.

Command: `ping -c 4 TARGET_IP`

Breakdown:
- `-c 4` → sends 4 packets only (clean output, fast)

Output:

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ping -c 4 TARGET_IP
PING TARGET_IP (TARGET_IP) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from TARGET_IP: icmp_seq=1 ttl=63 time=190 ms
64 bytes from TARGET_IP: icmp_seq=2 ttl=63 time=190 ms
64 bytes from TARGET_IP: icmp_seq=3 ttl=63 time=191 ms
64 bytes from TARGET_IP: icmp_seq=4 ttl=63 time=194 ms

--- TARGET_IP ping statistics ---
4 packets transmitted, 4 received, 0% packet loss, time 3006ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 189.991/191.283/193.771/1.479 ms
```

A successful response confirms that the machine is active and accessible on the HTB network, allowing us to proceed with the enumeration phase.

## 2. Enumeration

### 2.1. Port Scan with Nmap

Before we can attack a system, we need to find out what "doors" are open. Doors in this context are ports. We use a tool called **Nmap** (Network Mapper) to scan the target's IP address and see what services are running.

#### 2.1.1. The "Spearfishing" Scan (All Ports, High Speed)

Command: `nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 -Pn TARGET_IP`

Breakdown:
- **`nmap`**
    - **Description:** The utility itself.
- **`-p-`**
    - **Description:** All Ports Scan. 
    - **Purpose:** Scans all 65,535 ports. Slower but thorough.
- `--min-rate 5000`
	- **Description:** Minimum Packet Rate.
	- **Purpose:** Forces Nmap to send at least 5,000 packets per second. This drastically reduces scan time on stable networks like the HTB VPN.
- `-Pn`
    - **Description:** Skip Host Discovery.
    - **Purpose:** Treats the host as "online" even if it doesn't respond to pings (ICMP). Many HTB boxes have firewalls that block pings.
- **`TARGET_IP`**
    - **Description:** Target Specification.
    - **Purpose:** The IP address of the host being scanned.

Output:

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 -Pn TARGET_IP       
Starting Nmap 7.98 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2026-02-22 01:57 -0500

```

</div>

#### 2.1.2. The "Deep Dive" Scan (Targeted Aggression)

Command: `nmap -A -p 22,80,443,6661 TARGET_IP  `

Breakdown:
- `-sC`
    - **Description:** Default Script Scan.
    - **Purpose:** Runs a collection built-in Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) scripts to find common vulnerabilities, metadata, or hidden info.
- `-sV`
    - **Description:** Version Detection.
    - **Purpose:** Probes open ports to determine what software and version are actually running (e.g., identifying "Jetty" or "OpenSSH 9.2").
- `-p 22,80,443,6661`
    - **Description:** Targeted Port List.
    - **Purpose:** Restricts the heavy scanning to only the ports you confirmed are open, saving significant time and processing power.

#### 2.1.3. Scan Results Analysis

| **Service**       | **Version**             | **Analysis**                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenSSH**       | `9.2p1`                 | **Low Priority.** This is a modern, patched version of SSH on Debian. Direct exploits are extremely rare. I will keep this as a potential "lateral movement" point if I find credentials later. |
| **Jetty**         | `(Web Server)`          | **Supporting Tech.** Jetty itself is usually secure, but it’s the "engine" for the real target (Mirth).                                                                                         |
| **Mirth Connect** | `Unknown` (* To Verify) | **HIGH PRIORITY.** This software has several high-severity RCE bugs (like CVE-2023-43208). <br>**Priority 1:** Find the specific version number.                                                |

### 2.2. Enumeration of Web Services (Port 80)
#### 2.2.1. Web Enumeration

Browse to `TARGET_IP`.

#### 2.2.2. Fingerprinting (The "What")

I consulted the **Horizon3.ai** technical disclosure for **CVE-2023-43208**.

NextGen Mirth Connect Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2023-43208)[^1]

</div>

#### 2.2.3. Detection

Command: `curl -Lk -H 'X-Requested-With: OpenAPI' https://TARGET_IP/api/server/version`

Breakdown: 

- `curl`
    - Description: Client URL Utility. 
    - Purpose: The tool used to interact with the web API.
- `-Lk`
    - Description: Follow Links (`L`) and Insecure (`k`).
    - Purpose: The Horizon3 post notes that Mirth often redirects to HTTPS. `-L` follows that redirect, and `-k` ignores the self-signed certificate warning common on HTB. 
- `-H 'X-Requested-With: OpenAPI'`
    - Description: Custom HTTP Header.
    - Purpose: The Horizon3 research explains that Mirth’s Java servlet filter checks for this specific header to prevent CSRF. Without this header, the server would reject your request even if the path is correct.
- `/api/server/version`
    - Description: Target API Endpoint. 
    - Purpose: As documented in the research, this is the specific URI that returns the software version string without requiring a login.

Output:

```shell
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ curl -Lk -H 'X-Requested-With: OpenAPI' https://10.129.1.153/api/server/version
4.4.0    
```

This **`4.4.0`** result is exactly what we were looking for. Any Mirth Connect version **less than 4.4.1** is confirmed vulnerable to **CVE-2023-43208**, which is a critical, **unauthenticated** Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested packaging==24.0
    pwncat-cs 0.5.4 depends on packaging<21.0 and >=20.9

Additionally, some packages in these conflicts have no matching distributions available for your environment:
    packaging

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict

ERROR: ResolutionImpossible: for help visit https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/dependency-resolution/#dealing-with-dependency-conflicts
```

The script I cloned has a very strict `requirements.txt` that forces `packaging==24.0`, but `pwncat-cs` is an older tool that specifically demands an older version of that same library (`<21.0`). They are fighting, and `pip` is giving up.

**The good news:** You don't actually need the complex `pwncat-cs` or the "fancy" progress bars to run this exploit. You just need `requests` to send the payload and `rich` to see the script's output.

The Fix: 
1. Install the core essentials (ignoring the conflict): `pip install requests rich alive-progress`
2. Forget `pwncat-cs` for now: The script wants to use `pwncat` as a listener, but you can use the standard **Netcat** (`nc`) which is already installed on your Kali system and never has dependency issues.

#### 3.2. Start your Listener (The "Catcher")

Open a **new terminal tab** on your Kali machine. This needs to be running _before_ you launch the exploit so it's ready to catch the incoming connection.

Command: `nc -lvnp 4444`
